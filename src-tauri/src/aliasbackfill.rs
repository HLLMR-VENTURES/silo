//! Catalog links for zips Silo installed under another name before #388 (#402).
//!
//! Since #388 a Browse install records which catalog entry a zip came from when the file isn't
//! named after the entry's techName (`catalogalias`). A zip installed that way earlier has no
//! record, so its drawer said "Not in Silo's catalog", update checks skipped it and Verify
//! integrity said Unverified. This looks such zips up by their bytes and records the same link
//! an install would have.
//!
//! A zip is looked at when its file name is its techName (as the joins require), the catalog
//! has no entry with that techName (`POST /mods/lookup`), and its bytes have no link yet. Silo
//! hashes it and asks the catalog which entries have a build with exactly those bytes
//! (`POST /mods/by-hash`: one request for a run's files, answered from one query on the
//! server, silo-api#39). It records the link when exactly one entry has, that entry's build of
//! those bytes downloads as a file of the zip's own name (a Browse install saves the file under
//! its download's name), and the entry isn't named after the zip. Otherwise it records nothing.
//! The record is an install's (`catalogalias::record`), made under the library lock.
//!
//! When the catalog has no `by-hash` route yet (a SiloAPI from before it), nothing is decided;
//! that's logged once per session, and the files are looked at once it has one.
//!
//! When it runs: it sends some mod names to the catalog, so only with the user's leave to
//! check for updates, and never for a mod left out of update checks: after a library scan when
//! the startup update check is on, and beside an update check of the library. Off the UI
//! thread, in the background, one run at a time (a run asked for while one is going is
//! skipped; a later one takes its files). The window hears which mods were linked
//! (`catalog:linked`), and the drawer and the Updates list ask again.
//!
//! Each version of a file (its path, size and modified time, as the scan cache keys it) is
//! decided once: then it isn't hashed or looked up again until the file changes. A failed or
//! offline lookup, a busy library, or a file that can't be read or changes meanwhile decides
//! nothing, so that file is tried again next time, behind files not tried yet; a hash already
//! taken is kept for it, and so is the catalog's "no entry has this techName" (for a day), so
//! the next runs hash such a file without asking for its name again. A run stops at its `Limits`
//! (names looked up, files hashed, time, checked before every request and file; a record waits
//! for the library lock no longer than the run has left, and only once a run); the rest wait
//! for the next run. A run's notes go to the database in at most three transactions, and a
//! busy database stops the run. Whether a file's bytes already have a link is only decided
//! under the library lock, where an install's own record can't be half done. The answer to the hash lookup is read whole or refused (at most 1 MiB).
//! Nothing here is shown to the user as an error; it's only logged.
