//! Scratch entries Silo makes beside a mod (#394), and the journal that proves they're Silo's:
//! - an archive move's in-flight copy (`MoveTmp`, `….silo-move-tmp`);
//! - the old copy an archive move is deleting (`MoveOld`, `….silo-move-old`);
//! - the temp a relink makes before renaming it over a mods-folder entry (`RelinkTmp`,
//!   `….silo-relink-tmp`);
//! - a download's part file (`Part`: `….silo-update.part` for an update, `….part` for an
//!   install) (#400).
//!
//! The journal also lists the update backups Silo made (`UpdateBak`, #400). Those aren't
//! scratch: no sweep looks at them. Only `update::prune_backups` removes one, and only a
//! recorded one past the newest few of its mod.
//!
//! Each gets a name of its own (`<name>.<token><suffix>`, see [`unique_beside`]), is recorded
//! in the journal *before* it is made, and is made exclusively (never over anything already
//! there). Only a recorded entry is ever deleted, and only once [`sweep_where`] proves it isn't the
//! only copy of anything. Scratch names from older versions (`<name><suffix>`, never recorded)
//! and anything else unrecorded are left in place and logged ([`log_unrecorded`]). The
//! suffixes stay what they were, so `scan::is_silo_temp` keeps skipping both styles.
