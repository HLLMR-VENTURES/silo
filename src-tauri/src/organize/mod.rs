//! The organize / projection engine — the only code that writes to the game's mods
//! folder. Model (chosen by the user):
//!
//! * **At rest:** every mod is moved into `mods/archive/<Category>/` (subfolders the
//!   game ignores, since it only reads the flat root).
//! * **Active:** the chosen set is projected back into the flat root as **hardlinks**
//!   (zips) or dir links (unpacked mods) — same volume as the archive, so no admin /
//!   Developer Mode and no disk duplication. The game reads the flat root and loads
//!   exactly the active set.
//! * **Flatten:** everything moves back to a vanilla flat `mods/`; only *empty* archive
//!   directories are removed. Anything Silo doesn't recognize is left in place, never
//!   deleted — always one step from stock, and never a step that eats a file.
//!
//! Every move/link is recorded in the `organized` manifest so cleanup only ever
//! touches Silo-owned entries; nothing the user placed is deleted. Failures are
//! collected and reported, not panicked on.
//!
//! ## Module map
//!
//! Split out of the old single `organize.rs` (#186) as a pure move. Each file does
//! `use super::*;` and this module glob-re-exports each one, so every item keeps its
//! `organize::` path and its visibility to the rest of the crate.
//!
//! * `mod.rs` (here): the shared types: [`Layout`], [`ModInput`], [`PlannedMove`],
//!   [`Report`], [`RelinkReport`], and archive naming (`archive_dir` / `archive_path`).
//! * `engine`: the layout engine: [`plan_organize`] / [`apply_organize`] (file mods into the
//!   archive), [`set_active`] (project the active set), [`flatten`], and archive cleanup.
//! * `relink`: [`relink_projections`] (copies → links) and the atomic zip re-link
//!   (`replace_zip_link*`, `note_zip_projection`).
//! * `adopt`: [`adopt_foreign`] / [`restore_projection`] for a file the user swapped in, and the
//!   `backups/` naming (`update_backup_path`, …).
//! * `fsops`: filesystem primitives: `move_path` (rename, or cross-drive copy-then-remove),
//!   no-replace flushed copies (`copy_new`, `place_new`, `copy_dir_all`), temp handling.
//! * `links`: making and removing projections: `make_link`, `LinkPolicy` (hardlink → symlink
//!   → copy), folder links / junctions, `remove_link`.
//! * `volumes`: link probes ([`supports_hardlinks`], [`supports_symlinks`], probe sweeping) and
//!   mounts / same-volume checks (`mount_of`, `volume_relation`, `same_volume_for_links`).
//! * `foldercopy`: copy-fallback folder projections: the ownership marker, `copy_unchanged`,
//!   `retire_folder_copy`.
//! * `foreign`: ownership detection: `is_silo_projection` and [`detect_foreign_projections`].
//! * `tests/`: the unit tests, one file per module above (`tests/layout.rs` covers this file);
//!   shared fixtures in `tests/mod.rs`.
